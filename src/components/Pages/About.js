        <div className="Phrase">
          My name is Renan, I am from Brazil-born in 1988, I have four brothers
          being the middle child. I got married in 2016 and in 2018 we decided
          to take a risk crossing the ocean to try new experiences in England
          where I currently live in the city of London. As a person, I am a
          homely person, I like to stay at home watching a movie, series etc.
          Whenever possible, I travel to visit my friends who live here in
          Europe. One of my passions is programming and software architecture. I
          am always looking to improve my knowledge, participating in workshops
          and always seeking to update myself with new technologies.
